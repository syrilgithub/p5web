        <h1 class = "animate__animated animate__backInLeft">Discord Bots</h1>
        <p>I find discord bots to be one of the easiest tools when learning and
           showing off what a person knows in terms of setting a scope, technical
           skills and management. Discord bots allowed me to experiment with user input 
           and formulate solutions to problems. For example, a user might want to generate
           thier own QR code for a link to share with a friend or they want to know all 
           the facts about their favorite movie. My bot can do that with accepting user input 
           and displaying the information the user wants or needs. With my specific bot I tried to make it a one stop shop.
           All of the important thing surrounding the bot can be found on my github in the 
           readme of the bot.

        <p>The popular source engine based game created by Facepunch StudiosÂ© allowed for users to create their
           own server(s). I delved right into this concept because it allowed me as an individual to be a developer, 
           manager, business-person and provided me with a great opportunity to work on a codebase. Unfortunately the projects
           did not have a main "source code" to provide here nor was I able to capture the forums I created due to an archive.org 
           webcrawler error.

        <p>MTSI is a international construction solutions company. MTSI provides services related to air filtration, project
           management, fabrication etc. I created their website using a popular CMS. This website allows users to (optional) live chat
           with sales, send contact request and within the contact request users can upload documents for order forms. Also showed company
           management how to use sharepoint and provided the company with hardware support.

            Ethical hacking is a newfound interest of mine. As I have experince with simple networking in relation to web hosting, server hosting etc.
            I plan on really go in on this path of IT.
